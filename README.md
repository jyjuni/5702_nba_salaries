# Are Certain NBA Players Overpaid?

## Introduction
In this project, we are curious about how NBA teams decide the salaries of their players. Specifically, we raise the following questions to start with:
1. Which factors play the most important role in deciding player salaries. How are they measured in the salary system (performance - more specific metrics left to be explored), age, race, popularity, changing team or not)

2. Among all nba players, which individuals or groups are most overpaid or underpaid?

3. Which team tends to pay high salaries for their players, why? (to retain existing palyers for another term or to hire player from other, etc)

## Data
We retrieved the data on player performance from https://www.basketballreference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html and retrieved the salary data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html. Data from basketballreference.com were retrieved from <i>Sportradar</i>, which is also the official stats partner of the NBA.<i>Sportradar</i> offers various scales of data collection systems, and most of times their data journalists would collect NBA data at a venue or from TV. Those collected data would then be uploaded, processed and distributed using different channels. The race data of players is
collected from https://www.interbasket.net/news/what-percentage-of-nba-players-are-black-howmany-are-white/31018/. 

Note that there is no specific data of each player’s race in authoritative websites, but this link is a blog where the author collect the raw data directly from the NBA  official website, and we scraped the link as our race data. We would double check players’ race as we are combining the two data sets.

The salary would be the dependent variable, while other data, including performance, age, and race would be the independent variables, among which both numerical and categorical variables exist. We could implement the techniques from class to visualize the correlation between independent variables and the dependent variable. There are many associations, correlations, and relationships to be explored in our data.
